# Civic-Hacking-Alder-Aggregator-Overview

Welcome! This repository is the home base for our **AI Coding Tools Demo Night**—a hands-on event where developers will use different AI coding assistants to build the same small web app live and in real time. We expect that we'll have three or four presenters, each taking about 20 minutes, and each building the same app (a blog aggregator for posts from Madison Common Council members) but each using a different coding tool - something like Cursor, Github Copilot, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, etc.

 Whether you're presenting, following along, or just curious, you'll find everything you need here to get started, collaborate, and contribute.

 Thursday, January 29th, 2026 at 6:00pm, at Madison College Truax Main Building, 1701 Wright Street, Conference Hall, room D1630.

**Event details and RSVP:**

## What's in this repo?

- **[INVITE.md](./INVITE.md):**  
  The full event announcement, including date, time, location, parking, and what to expect. Great for sharing or forwarding!

- **[SHORT_DESCRIPTION.md](./SHORT_DESCRIPTION.md):**  
  A concise description of the app we'll build together—a Madison Common Council blog aggregator. This can serve as an initial prompt for your AI coding tool. This is, of course, optional, and some presenters might prefer to start with their own prompt.

- **[SCRAPING_INFO.md](./SCRAPING_INFO.md):**  
  Practical details and CSS selectors for scraping alder blog posts, so you can focus on building features instead of reverse-engineering HTML. Again, this is optional, and presenters or coding tools might find it easier to let their coding agent fetch a page and detect all of this automatically. 

- **PRD Doc:**  
  *Coming soon*: A longer document that presenters can use as a Product Requirements Document, in case they want to start from there. Some presenters will want to have their coding tool create that document, along with a plan, during their session, so some folks won't use this document. 

## How to participate

- **Open a pull request** if you have improvements, corrections, or resources to share.
- **Raise an issue** if you spot a problem or have a question.
- **Join the discussion** in [GitHub Discussions](../../discussions) to suggest prompts, share ideas, or connect with other attendees.

Whether you're new to AI coding tools or a daily user, we hope you'll learn something new and help make this a welcoming, collaborative event. See you there!
